    The text is more properly called "Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis, or, 
    The little Key of Solomon". The title most commonly used, "The Lesser Key of Solomon,"
    does not in fact occur in the manuscripts. A.E. Waite, in his 1898 Book of Black Magic
    and of Pacts does use the terms "so-called Greater Key" and "Lesser Key" to distinguish 
    between the Clavicula Salomonis and Lemegeton, so he may have been the first one to coin it.

    The most obvious source for the Ars Goetia is Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum 
    in his De praestigiis daemonum. Weyer does not cite, and is unaware of, any other books 
    in the Lemegeton, suggesting that the Lemegeton was derived from his work, not the other 
    way around.[2][9] The order of the spirits changed between the two, four additional spirits 
    were added to the later work, and one spirit (Pruflas) was omitted.
